# CAIN
All files from the Fortran based EM interactions code CAIN used for inverse Compton scattering spectra. 

CAIN is a severely outdated tool but it may still be useful for benchmarking etc. and checking others work.

The CAIN files here so far are related to the CBETA ICS. The 42 and 150MeV beam passes specifically, _Long denotes many macroparticle examples. 

*Not sure about the current state of some of this code but there is definitely a functional example in here*
